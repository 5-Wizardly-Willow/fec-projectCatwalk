# fec-projectCatwalk
Front End Capstone Project at Hack Reactor.

## Motivation

This project was designed to grow our understanding of building, maintaining, and optimizing a full react application. While the project was completed as a group, each individual was fully responsible for their individual component. This allowed each of us to utilize and strengthen our understanding of front end development.
